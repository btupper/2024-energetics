We can read in a [merged table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ro1yU67PyDezR2tFYaSLomV7pfX_RGl4IGBuLsnAeW0/edit?usp=drive_link) to make analysis easier.  Here are the first 6 records...

```{r}
x = read_downeast() 
knitr::kable(head(x))
```

Plot a timeseries...

```{r}
plot_timeseries(x)
```

What's going on at 97 Main St?


How about by cost instead of volume burned?

```{r}
plot_timeseries(x, var = Cost)
```


And a monthly box plot by volume burned.

```{r}
plot_monthly(x)
```

And by cost...

```{r}
plot_monthly(x, var = Cost)
```

## Cost per unit

```{r}
plot_timeseries(x, var = CostPerUnit)
```
